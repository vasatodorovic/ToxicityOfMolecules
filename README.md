# Predicting Toxicity of Molecules Affecting CRY1 Protein Function

This repository contains the code and materials for a research project focused on predicting the toxicity of molecules influencing the function of the CRY1 protein.

## Overview

In this project, we employed various machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for assessing the toxicity of molecules. The primary techniques and methodologies used include:

- **Feature Selection:** We applied feature selection methods to identify the most relevant molecular features for toxicity prediction, enhancing model performance and interpretability. Methods that we applied are Variance Threshold, Select K Best and RFE.

- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** To handle class imbalance in the dataset, we utilized SMOTE to generate synthetic samples of the minority class, improving model training.

- **Decision Trees:** Decision tree models were employed to capture non-linear relationships within the data and provide valuable insights into the toxicity prediction process.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVMs were used for their ability to handle complex classification tasks and maximize predictive accuracy.

- **Ensemble Methods:** Ensemble techniques, such as Bagging, AdaBoost and Random Forest, were implemented to combine the strengths of multiple models and enhance overall predictive performance.
